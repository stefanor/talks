A craftsmsan is only as good as his tools
=========================================

.. notes::

    We are all developers.
    Good developers use good tools, and know how to use them well
    If we cant to be good developers...

----

Most Software Development isn't writing code
============================================

.. notes::

   University teaches you how to write code, but that's not what we
   actually do.
   Software developers mostly read, understand, and debug code.
   Or mangle data.

----

Unix
====

.. notes::

   Be it Linux or OSX, these days most developers use unix.
   At least, all the cool kids do.
   So, you should know it

----

Why should I listen to you?
===========================

.. notes::

   I'm a Linux geek.
   I was at UCT for far too many years, but recently quit my job to work
   for a pretty cool little Cape Town company called Yola.
